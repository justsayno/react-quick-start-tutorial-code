# React Quick Start Tutorial Code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for the tutorial on sethreid.co.nz.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the original guide from the generated app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
